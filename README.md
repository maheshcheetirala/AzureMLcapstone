# AzureMLcapstone
This is the repository for Azure Machine learning Nanodegree.
## Project Main Goal<br>
The main goal of the project is to utilize Azure Machine Learning Hyper Drive and Auto Ml capabilities to build a machine learning model and deploy the best model based
based on the performance evaluation metric.<br><br>
The Project architecture can be as below<br>

## Business Problem and Dataset <br>
Diabetes is on eof the diseases  suffered by many people across the globe in recent years. Many scientists are trying to find a permanent cure for this but could not be able to do
it. So I wanted to build a machine learning model with the clinical data available and predict whether a patient is having Diabetes or not based on the symptoms.<br>
## Dataset 
I have used the dataset from Kaggle which can be found here . [https://www.kaggle.com/kumargh/pimaindiansdiabetescsv](DiabetesDataset)<br>
